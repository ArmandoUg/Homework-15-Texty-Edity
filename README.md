# Homework-17-Texty-Edity


## Description
This is a read me file for the Text editor app that is in this repository.
This app uses node js, index db, service workers. The scripts in here will create and allow the user to use a basic text editor app that can function on the browser and would allow the user to download the application to allow the use to open up the web application on the user's desktop.

The app is also deployed via heroku.
